                A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that
                <ul>
                    <li> is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity,</li>
                    <li> not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and</li>
                    <li> cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals</li>

                There are eight planets in the Solar System, which are in increasing distance from the Sun:

        </div>
        <div id="Mercury">
            <p>
                <h2>Mercury</h2>
                Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.</br>
                Its orbital period (about 88 Earth days) is less than any other planet in the Solar System.</br>
                Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days. It has no known natural satellites</br>
                It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Venus">
            <p>
                <h2>Venus</h2>
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.</br>
                It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System.</br>
                It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</br>
                Because Venus orbits within Earth's orbit it is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun.</br>
                Its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8Â°.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Earth">
            <p>
                <h2>Earth</h2>
                Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and </br>
                the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.</br>
                It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.</br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Mars">
            <p>
                <h2>Mars</h2>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury.</br>
                Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the "Red Planet"</br>
                because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Jupiter">
            <p>
                <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.</br>
                It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, </br>
                but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.</br>
                Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants.</br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Saturn">
            <p>
                <h2>Saturn</h2>
                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.</br>
                It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.</br>
                Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Uranus">
            <p>
                <h2>Uranus</h2>
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and</br>
                fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. </br>
                Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition</br>
                from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.</br>
                For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants</br>
            </p>


            <div id="Neptune">
                <p>
                    <h2>Neptune</h2>
                    Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System.</br>
                    In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.</br>
                    Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass
                    of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.
