    <div id="Introduction">
        <p> <h2> Introduction </h2>
A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.<br>
The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias, literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way.</br>
Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion (109) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,</br>
each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.        
</p>
</div>
      <div id="Etymology">
          <p> <h2> Etymology </h2>
The origin of the word galaxy derives from the Greek term for the Milky Way, galaxias,</br>
or kyklos galaktikos ("milky circle") due to its appearance as a "milky" band of light in the sky.</br>
In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's breast</br>
while she is asleep so that the baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become immortal.</br>
Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: </br>
she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills and, produces the faint band of light known as the Milky Way.

    <p> <h2> Nomenclature </h2>
Tens of thousands of galaxies have been catalogued, but only a few have well-established names,</br>
 such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy.</br>
Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue),</br>
the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue</br> 
of Galaxies) and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies). All of the well-known galaxies appear </br>
in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number.</br>

    <p> <h2> Modern research </h2>
In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable </br>
from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas;[51] and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust absorption,</br> 
and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in our galaxy.</br>
These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy.</br> 
With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies. </br>
In the 1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed</br>
and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas.
