In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable </br>
from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas;[51] and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust absorption,</br> 
and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in our galaxy.</br>
These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy.</br> 
With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies. </br>
In the 1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed</br>
and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas.
