        <h2>Milky Way</h2>
        <p>
            
            The Greek philosopher Democritus (450–370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way might
            consist of distant stars. Aristotle (384–322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition
            of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes
            place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions."
            The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that
            if the Milky Way is sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times
            and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is celestial.According
            to Mohani Mohamed, the Arabian astronomer Alhazen (965–1037) made the first attempt at observing and measuring
            the Milky Way's parallax,and he thus "determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it must be
            remote from the Earth, not belonging to the atmosphere."The Persian astronomer al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) proposed
            the Milky Way galaxy to be "a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars.

        <h2> Shell galaxy</h2>

<p>
A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.
