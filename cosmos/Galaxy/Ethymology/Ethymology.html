          <img src="..\..\images\gal1.jpg" alt="Galaxy"></br>
The origin of the word galaxy derives from the Greek term for the Milky Way, galaxias,</br>
or kyklos galaktikos ("milky circle") due to its appearance as a "milky" band of light in the sky.</br>
In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's breast</br>
while she is asleep so that the baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become immortal.</br>
Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: </br>
she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills and, produces the faint band of light known as the Milky Way.
