    <h2>Uranus</h2>
    <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in
        the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition
        from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune
        as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from a figure
        from Greek mythology, from the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Like the other giant planets,
        Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among
        those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its
        north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.In 1986, images from Voyager 2
        showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with
        the other giant planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus
        approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h, 560 mph).

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>
            ranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly
            the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BC may have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue
            that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest.The earliest definite sighting was in 1690 when John Flamsteed
            observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Lemonnier observed Uranus
            at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.

        <h2>Axial tilt</h2>
        <p>
            The Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77° (as
            defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. Near
            the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away. Only a narrow strip around the equator
            experiences a rapid day–night cycle, but with the Sun low over the horizon. At the other side of Uranus's orbit
            the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight,
            followed by 42 years of darkness.
