        <h2>Neptune</h2>

        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System.</br>
        In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.</br>
        Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass
        of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the
        Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit
        of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.
        Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position
        predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
        remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.

        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January
            1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions,
            Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the
            night sky hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune
            was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day.
