        <h2>Mercury</h2>

        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period (about 88 Earth days) is less than any
        other planet in the Solar System. Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days. It has
        no known natural satellites It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods. Like Venus, Mercury
        orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as a inferior planet, so it can only be seen visually in the morning or the evening
        sky, and never exceeds 28° away from the Sun. Also, like Venus and the Moon, it displays the complete range of phases
        as it moves around its orbit relative to Earth. Although Mercury can appear as a bright star-like object when viewed
        from Earth, its proximity to the Sun often makes it more difficult to see than Venus. Mercury is tidally or gravitationally
        locked with the Sun in a 3:2 resonance,and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative
        to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.As
        seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every
        two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two years.

        <h2>Surface geology</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Because knowledge of Mercury's geology had been based only on the 1975 Mariner 10 flyby and terrestrial observations, it is the least understood of the terrestrial planets.As data from MESSENGER orbiter are processed, this knowledge will increase. For example, an unusual crater with radiating troughs has been discovered that scientists called "the spider".It was later named Apollodorus.

        <h2>Internal structure</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi). Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.
