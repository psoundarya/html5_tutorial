        A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that
        <ul>
            <li> is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity,</li>
            <li> not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and</li>
            <li> cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals</li>
            There are eight planets in the Solar System, which are in increasing distance from the Sun
        </ul>

                The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar
                System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries
                of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number
                of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution
                defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects
                of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before
                1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and
                Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered),
                that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific
                age. The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar
                systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy. The five classical
                planets, being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact
                on mythology, religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy. In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain
                lights moved across the sky, as opposed to the "fixed stars", which maintained a constant relative position
                in the sky from which today's word "planet" was derived. In ancient Greece, China, Babylon, and indeed all
                pre-modern civilizations.

            <p>
                n 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about
                its axis, which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars.
                He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong
                in South India, where his principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth, among others, were followed and a
                number of secondary works were based on them.
