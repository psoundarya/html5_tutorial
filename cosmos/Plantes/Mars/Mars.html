        <h2>Mars</h2>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the
        Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives
        it a reddish appearance. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth,
        as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest
        known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The
        smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars
        has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,similar
        to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

        <h2>Internal structure</h2>
        <p>
            Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials. Current models of its interior
            imply a core with a radius of about 1,794 ± 65 kilometers (1,115 ± 40 mi), consisting primarily of iron and nickel
            with about 16–17% sulfur.This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements than Earth's.The
            core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet,
            but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are
            iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km
            (31 mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 km (78 mi). Earth's crust averages 40 km (25 mi).

        <h2>Surface geology</h2>
        <p>
            Mars is a terrestrial planet that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically
            make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich
            than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest
            concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations
            of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium
            pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found.Much of the surface is deeply covered
            by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.
