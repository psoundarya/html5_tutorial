        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth
        that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is
        a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter is
        primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth
        of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements,but like the other giant planets, Jupiter
        lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid
        (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several
        bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent
        result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it
        was first seen by telescope.

        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
            Jupiter's upper atmosphere is composed of about 88–92% hydrogen and 8–12% helium by percent volume of gas molecules. A helium
            atom has about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom, so the composition changes when described as the proportion
            of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium
            by mass, with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. The interior contains denser
            materials, such that the distribution is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements by mass. The
            atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also
            traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur.

        <h2>Internal structure</h2>
        <p>
            Jupiter is thought to consist of a dense core with a mixture of elements, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen
            with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen. Beyond this basic outline, there
            is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown,
            as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the
            existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements,indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times
            that of Earth, or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter.
