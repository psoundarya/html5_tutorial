        <h2>Earth</h2>

        Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor
        life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. According to
        radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago.Earth's gravity interacts
        with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. During one orbit around
        the Sun, Earth rotates about its axis over 365 times, thus an Earth year is about 365.26 days long.Earth's axis of
        rotation is tilted, producing seasonnal variations on the planet's surface.The gravitational interaction between
        the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

        <h2>Name and etymology</h2>
        <p>
            The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms,which derived from an Old English noun
            most often spelled eorðe.[42] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their proto-Germanic root has been
            reconstructed as *erþō. In its earliest appearances, eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses
            of Latin terra and Greek γῆ (gē): the ground,its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including
            the sea),and the globe itself.As with Terra and Gaia, Earth was a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: the
            Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus, and later Norse mythology included Jörð, a giantess
            often given as the mother of Thor.

        <h2>Geological history</h2>
        <p>
            Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor. The origin of the
            world's oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.
            In this model, atmospheric "greenhouse gases" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only
            70% of its current luminosity. By 3.5 Gya, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere
            from being stripped away by the solar wind.
