    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period (243 days)
        of any planet in the Solar System. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
        Because Venus orbits within Earth's orbit it is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun.
        Its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°. Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called
        Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically
        different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting
        of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly
        the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System,
        with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
            The Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th
            century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular
            rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism,
            and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been some recent eruptions. About 80% of the Venusian
            surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or
            lobate plains.Two highland "continents" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern
            hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra, after Ishtar
            the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus,
            lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11 km above the Venusian average surface elevation. The southern continent
            is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at
            roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.
