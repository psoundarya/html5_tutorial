        <h2>Saturn</h2>

        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with
        an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with
        its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of
        iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen,
        an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer
        layer.Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the
        metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's,
        but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is
        around one-twentieth of Jupiter's

        <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Saturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium ('gas'). It lacks a definite surface, though
            it may have a solid core.Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is
            flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268
            km versus 54,364 km, respectively. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System,
            are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than
            water—about 30% less.

        <h2>Internal structure</h2>
        <p>
            Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded
            by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles.This core is similar in composition to the Earth,
            but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior,
            allowed French astronomers Didier Saumon and Tristan Guillot to place constraints on the mass of Saturn's core.
            In 2004, they estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter
            of about 25,000 km.
