The oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC.</br>
The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia</br> 
in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period.</br>
The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis.</br>
