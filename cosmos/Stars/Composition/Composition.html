     <img src="..\..\images\star3.png" alt="Star"></br>
When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium,</br>
as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements.</br>
Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere,</br>
as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure.</br>
