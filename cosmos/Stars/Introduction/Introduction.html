A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.</br>
Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night,</br>
appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth.</br>
Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of</br> 
 which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and</br>
 provide standardized stellar designations.
