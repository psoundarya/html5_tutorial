            <h2>Designations</h2>
            <p>
                The concept of a constellation was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent
                arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their
                myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology.
                Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.

        <h2>Star formation</h2>
        <p>
            The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density
            - often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar
            medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy).
            When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins
            to collapse under its own gravitational force As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust
            and gas form "Bok globules". As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts
            into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition
            of hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at the core. These pre–main sequence stars are often surrounded
            by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational
            contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.

        <h2>Main sequence</h2>
        <p>
            Stars spend about 90% of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near
            the core. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence, and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main
            sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the
            core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.The Sun, for example, is estimated to
            have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion (4.6 × 109) years ago.
