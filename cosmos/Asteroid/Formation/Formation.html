It is thought that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the solar nebula until</br>
Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from orbital resonances with Jupiter ejected over 99%</br> 
of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that </br>
asteroids larger than approximately 120 km (75 mi) in diameter accreted during that early era, whereas smaller</br>
bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption.
