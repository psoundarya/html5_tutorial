            <h2>Surface features</h2>
            <p>
                Most asteroids outside the "big four" (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance,
                if irregular in shape. 50-km (31-mi) 253 Mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters
                the size of the asteroid's radius, and Earth-based observations of 300-km (186-mi) 511 Davida, one of the
                largest asteroids after the big four, reveal a similarly angular profile, suggesting it is also saturated
                with radius-size craters. Medium-sized asteroids such as Mathilde and 243 Ida that have been observed up
                close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface. Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically
                unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise
                a spheroid. Ceres seems quite different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are
                unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will be expanded with the Dawn spacecraft,
                which entered Ceres orbit on 6 March 2015.

            <h2>Orbital classification</h2>
            <p>
                Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions,
                it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups
                are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic
                break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.Families have only been recognized within the asteroid
                belt. They were first recognized by Kiyotsugu Hirayama in 1918 and are often called Hirayama families in
                his honor. About 30â€“35% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have
                a common origin in a past collision between asteroids. A family has also been associated with the plutoid
                dwarf planet Haumea.

            <h2>Rotation</h2>
            <p>
                Measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit. No asteroid
                with a diameter larger than 100 meters has a rotation period smaller than 2.2 hours. For asteroids rotating
                faster than approximately this rate, the inertia at the surface is greater than the gravitational force,
                so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more
                rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are rubble piles formed through
                accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.
