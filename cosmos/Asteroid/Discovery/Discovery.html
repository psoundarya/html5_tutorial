The first asteroid to be discovered, Ceres, was found in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, and was originally </br>
considered to be a new planet. This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which, with the</br>
equipment of the time, appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc</br>
though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions.
