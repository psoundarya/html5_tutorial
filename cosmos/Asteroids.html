<div id="Introduction">
    <p> <h2>Introduction</h2>
Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System.</br>
The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object</br> 
orbiting the Sun that did not showthe disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet.

<div id="Discovery">
    <p> <h2> Discovery </h2>
The first asteroid to be discovered, Ceres, was found in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, and was originally </br>
considered to be a new planet. This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which, with the</br>
equipment of the time, appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc</br>
though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions.

<div id="Formation">
    <p> <h2> Formation </h2>
It is thought that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the solar nebula until</br>
Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from orbital resonances with Jupiter ejected over 99%</br> 
of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that </br>
asteroids larger than approximately 120 km (75 mi) in diameter accreted during that early era, whereas smaller</br>
bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption.

    <div id="Historically">
        <p> <h2> Historically method</h2>
Asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries.</br>
In the last years of the 18th century, Baron Franz Xaver von Zach organized a group of 24</br> 
astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 AU from the Sun by the Titius-Bode law,</br>
 partly because of the discovery, by Sir William Herschel in 1781, of the planet Uranus at the distance predicted by the law.
