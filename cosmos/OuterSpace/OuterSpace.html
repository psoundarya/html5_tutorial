    <h2> OuterSpace</h2>
    <strong>OuterSpace</strong>, deep space, or just space, is the void that exists between celestial bodies, including Earth.It
    is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma
    of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust and cosmic rays. The baseline
    temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (K) (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F).Plasma
    with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per</br>
    cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins in the space between galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary)
    matter in outer space.

        <h2> Discovery</h2>
        <p>
            In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that became known as the horror
            vacui.
            </br>
            This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible
            existence of a void in space.Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held
            for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes
            argued that the entirety of space must be filled.

    <h2> Formation</h2>
    <p>
        According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe originated in an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago
        and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and
        electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became
        decoupled,allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion
        has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind
        a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.
