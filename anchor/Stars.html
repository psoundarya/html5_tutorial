A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.</br>
Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night,</br>
appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth.</br>
Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of</br> 
 which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and</br>
 provide standardized stellar designations.

The oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC.</br>
The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia</br> 
in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period.</br>
The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis.</br>

When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium,</br>
as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements.</br>
Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere,</br>
as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure.</br>
